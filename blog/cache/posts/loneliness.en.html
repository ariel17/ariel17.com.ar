<p>There was a moment in mi life that I felt so lonelely, like this. It was a
felling so cozy as vertiginous, in an era that melancholy was the banner on
my battles. To take decissions that change your life is like to be in the
corner of a precipice, talking to yourself. Contemplating something
beautiful and immense, have jumped was the better choice.</p>
