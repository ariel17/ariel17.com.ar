<p>In <a class="reference external" href="https://www.movile.com/en/">Movile</a> (yes, <a class="reference external" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PirVtiJuvDs"><em>I'm back</em></a>) had begun an auto-training program, where the
classes where scheduled with <a class="reference external" href="http://www.proyectosagiles.org/que-es-open-space">Open Space</a> technique. One topic porposed by me
was to learnd <a class="reference external" href="https://www.docker.com/">Docker</a> since I never worked with this tools.</p>
<p>It was my work to find the ways to bring someone who could teach us this
technology... but my pride and I never pretended that this person to be any
other than me, so I sit my head to learn <a class="reference external" href="https://www.docker.com/">Docker</a> this last weekend. The result
was <a class="reference external" href="http://ariel17.github.io/docker-talk/"><strong>these slides</strong></a> (made with <a class="reference external" href="http://sphinx-doc.org/">Sphinx</a> and <a class="reference external" href="https://hieroglyph.readthedocs.org/en/latest/">Hieroglyph</a>) and a 25 minutes talk
:).</p>
<p>I need to improve:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Slow down the talk velocity on topics: the talk was thinked to last ~40
minutes and instead it lasted a bit more than the half of time.</li>
<li>Change the voice tone to avoid monotony.</li>
</ul>
<p>The next class is about <a class="reference external" href="https://www.python.org/">Python</a> :D I'm kinda happy.</p>
