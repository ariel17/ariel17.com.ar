<h2>Listen when your code pushes back</h2>
<p>Listen to your code. It will offer suggestions. It will push back. It will tell
you where the pitfalls reside. It will suggest new ways to do things. It will
help you stick to a model of less software.</p>
<p>Is a new feature requiring weeks of time and thousands of lines of code? That's
your code telling you there's probably a better way. Is there a simple way to
code something in one hour instead of a complicated way that will take ten
hours? Again, that's your code guiding you. Listen.</p>
<p>Your code can guide you to fixes that are cheap and light. Pay attention when
an easy path emerges. Sure, the feature that's easy to make might not be
exactly the same as the feature you originally had in mind but so what? If it
works well enough and gives you more time to work on something else, itâ€™s a
keeper.</p>

<h2>Listen up</h2>
<p><em>Don't worry about design, if you listen to your code a good design will
appear... Listen to the technical people. If they are complaining about the
difficulty of making changes, then take such complaints seriously and give them
time to fix things.</em></p>
<p>-Martin Fowler, Chief Scientist, ThoughtWorks (from <a class="reference external" href="http://martinfowler.com/articles/designDead.html">Is Design Dead?</a>)</p>

<h2>If Programmers Got Paid To Remove Code...</h2>
<p><em>If programmers got paid to remove code from sofware instead of writing new
code, software would be a whole lot better.</em></p>
<p>-Nicholas Negroponte, Professor of Media Technology at the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology and founding chairman of MIT's Media Laboratory.</p>
