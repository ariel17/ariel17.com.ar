I am Ariel Gerardo RÃ­os. I am a **software developer**.

I love programming; I do it mainly in Python and Java, although those are not
the only languages (I have a dark past on PHP). I use GitHub_ to store my
project's repositories. I program because I enjoy it :) I feel lucky about
doing what I like. And I do it with **passion**. I want to reach the "*1
year-1 new language*" learning pace.

I like to **administrate** Linux servers too. In this area I am very interested
about applications that facilitate support and task automatization on
production environments.

Designing web sites never was never an skill for me; I am a born backend
developer... although I am losing fear learning to build interfaces. Shortly I
will create a decent web site, you will see :D

For **professional** contact I use LinkedIn_ or simply by email_. I use Twitter
as user `@ariel_17_`_ for spontaneous comments or share sites that caught my
attention. I not usually do explosive declarations; I am quite sincere so there
is not much left to use for get people to be surprised XD. In Projects_ section
can be seen a list about what I am/was working on.
